# SparseMatrixGraphs.jl
A minimal Graphs.jl implementation of a SparseMatrixCSC-based bidirectional graph with arbitrary edge properties


* The code should implement the minimal Graphs interface
* In addition, it implements inedges and outedges for fast access to neighborhood properties
* It stores a version of both the direct and the transposed matrix for efficient access
